LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_GOD_MINORIKO3,Seija: These sweet potatoes are from that harvest goddess... huh? What was her name again?
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_GOD_MINORIKO4,Seija: You must’ve been hungry, huh? Go ahead, take some.
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_GOD_MIMA1,Seija: I heard it contains the ultimate magic. Use it wisely.
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_GOD_MIMA2,Seija: Is this that “Spark” spellbook or something? That magic’s totally broken.
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_GOD_MIMA3,Seija: A vengeful spirit? It was written by one!? I won’t be cursed for reading it, right?
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_GOD_MIMA4,Seija: You’ve got a good eye. That’s a pretty rare book.
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_GOD_SHINKI1,Seija: A god of Makai? You mean that dopey-looking one?
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_GOD_SHINKI2,Seija: I was surprised Makai wasn’t a total wreck. I expected some ugly monsters.
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_GOD_SHINKI3,Seija: It’s easy to get lost in Makai. Be careful if you ever go.
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_GOD_SHINKI4,Seija: The demons chased me endlessly… Take this and try to throw them off my trail, yeah?
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_GOD_YUUGI1,Seija: I’d rather avoid fighting an oni. Run as fast as you can.
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_GOD_YUUGI2,Seija: These armors are one of the oni’s treasures. Too bad I got to them first.
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_GOD_YUUGI3,Seija: You’ll need armor if you want to survive a punch from an oni.
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_GOD_YUUGI4,Seija: I think I have a personality that oni love to hate. Mind dealing with them for me?
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_GOD_SHIZUHA1,Seija: Fallen maple leaves are just pathetic, don’t you think?
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_GOD_SHIZUHA2,Seija: That god seemed like they’d leave no impression at all. Here, take this.
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_GOD_SHIZUHA3,Seija: Not sure, but when I took this, I felt like someone was watching me the whole time.
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_GOD_SHIZUHA4,Seija: Honestly, the best fights are the ones where you stab 'em in the back. Agree?
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_GOD_HINA1,Seija: I didn’t need these cursed items anyway. Take them all.
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_GOD_HINA2,Seija: Looks like a valuable ring, sure… but it gives me the creeps. No thanks.
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_GOD_HINA3,Seija: Someone actually curses their own gear on purpose? No way.
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_GOD_HINA4,Seija: I’ll give it to you if you want, but watch out for the curse.
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_GOD_YUKARI1,Seija: I didn’t want to get mixed up with that creepy youkai.
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_GOD_YUKARI2,Seija: That youkai was sleeping when I went to steal these.
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_GOD_YUKARI3,Seija: Nothing beats a teleport item when you’re on the run. Use it well.
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_GOD_YUKARI4,Seija: Teleporting’s useful, but man, the nausea is real. Ugh.
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_GOD_EIRIN1,Seija: I stole these potions from that apothecary’s house. Not sure what they do though.
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_GOD_EIRIN2,Seija: A pharmacist, huh? Then why all the poison?
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_GOD_EIRIN3,Seija: That room was full of weird tools I’d never seen before. Looked dangerous, so I passed.
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_GOD_EIRIN4,Seija: When you’re in a bind, there’s nothing like a good potion. Stay safe out there!
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_GOD_YUYUKO1,Seija: I really don’t wanna climb that long staircase again.
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_GOD_YUYUKO2,Seija: Ever since I stole this, ghosts won’t stop showing up.
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_GOD_YUYUKO3,Seija: A wraith that deals in death? That’s ominous.
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_GOD_YUYUKO4,Seija: Ghosts are easy to shake off, right? I believe in you, partner.
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_GOD_SATORI1,Seija: A mind-reading youkai, huh... Creepy.
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_GOD_SATORI2,Seija: I can't tell if they're pets or just being left to roam free.
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_GOD_SATORI3,Seija: Didn't seem all that strong. Wouldn’t want to run into them again though.
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_GOD_SATORI4,Seija: Hated as much as me, huh? Doesn’t mean I feel any camaraderie.
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_GOD_TENSI1,Seija: Someone actually trusts a guy like that? Strange taste, I must say.
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_GOD_TENSI2,Seija: Watch out for falling rocks from the sky.
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_GOD_TENSI3,Seija: You really need this junk? You’ve got unique taste.
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_GOD_TENSI4,Seija: For a celestial’s stuff, it all looked pretty cheap.
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_GOD_LILLY1,Seija: Fairies? Fighting for rights? What nonsense are they spouting now?
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_GOD_LILLY2,Seija: Fairies are just like bugs—no matter how many you squash, they keep coming back.
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_GOD_LILLY3,Seija: Not sure if fairy gear will help, but I swiped some. Give it a try.
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_GOD_LILLY4,Seija: That fairy just bombarded everything without looking. Total menace.
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_GOD_MIKO1,Seija: I got my hands on one of that show-off’s favorite capes.
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_GOD_MIKO2,Seija: I’ve already got one I like better, so you can have this.
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_GOD_MIKO3,Seija: Acts noble on the outside, but sly as a fox inside. I can tell.
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_GOD_MIKO4,Seija: Red cape? Blue cape? I dunno, doesn’t matter to me.
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_GOD_OKINA1,Seija: I broke a sweat trying to ditch that weird dancing group.
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_GOD_OKINA2,Seija: As if I’d ever be someone like that guy’s lackey.
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_GOD_OKINA3,Seija: I heard this item makes you invincible for a bit. Use it well.
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_GOD_OKINA4,Seija: I saw a door behind me, walked in, and stole this.
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_GOD_JUNKO1,Seija: Enhancing your gear is what really matters, right?
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_GOD_JUNKO2,Seija: Muttering about killing someone the whole time? What a creep.
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_GOD_JUNKO3,Seija: Purification is a blessing? What’s the point if you can’t use the item anymore?
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_GOD_JUNKO4,Seija: We might not have brute strength, but we’ve got brains—and gear.
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_WELCOME1,Seija: A new resistance is born! Welcome aboard!
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_WELCOME2,Seija: We’re gonna make the best team ever!
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_WELCOME3,Seija: Let’s give those arrogant jerks a taste of their own medicine!
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_WELCOME4,Seija: This is the beginning of our uprising!
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_WELCOME5,Seija: Power to the weak! Punishment for the strong!
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_REFUSE_ITEM1,Seija: Really? You don’t need any items? I kinda admire that confidence.
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_REFUSE_ITEM2,Seija: You’ll still help me out, even if you don’t take the gift, right?
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_REFUSE_ITEM3,Seija: No need to be polite, you know.
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_REFUSE_ITEM4,Seija: Got it, partner. You don’t need it.
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_REFUSE_ITEM5,Seija: Don’t come crying later.
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_REFUSE_ITEM6,Seija: Then I guess I’ll keep this treasure for myself.
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_DOUBT1,Seija: Feels like I’m getting the short end of the deal here.
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_DOUBT2,Seija: You know, I think we made it this far thanks to me.
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_DOUBT3,Seija: Hm... Here, take it.
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_DOUBT4,Seija: Kinda hate to give this up...
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_DOUBT5,Seija: I doubt this guy’s more useful than the item I gave up...
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_DOUBT6,Seija: Ugh, I really hate giving this up—ah, it’s nothing!
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_DOUBT7,Seija: Now that I think about it, I’m totally getting the short end here.
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_DOUBT_REFUSE_ITEM1,Seija: Are you *really* saying you don’t need it?
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_DOUBT_REFUSE_ITEM2,Seija: I’m offering you treasure—why would you say no?
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_DISTRUST1,Seija: ...
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_DISTRUST2,Seija looks visibly annoyed.
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_DISTRUST3,Seija: ...No matter how I look at it, I’m getting ripped off.
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_DISTRUST4,Seija: I heard there’s a god who gave gifts to followers and got betrayed.
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_DISTRUST5,Seija: Hmph… That smug face of yours is seriously irritating.
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_DISTRUST6,Seija: Wait a sec… Am I the one being used here?
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_DISTRUST7,Seija: Betray before being betrayed… That’s my creed.
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_DISTRUST_ITEM1,Seija: Hey, spill it. What’s your real game here?
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_DISTRUST_ITEM2,Seija: I can’t read you at all.
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_ABANDONED1,Seija: Listen up. I’m an Amanojaku to the core! I don’t do allies!
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_ABANDONED2,Seija: I knew it—you’re the enemy. You’re no friend to the weak!
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_ABANDONED3,Seija: You were planning to betray me, weren’t you? Well too bad—*I* betray *you*!
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_ABANDONED4,Seija: You’re the one who got used and tossed aside, you fool! I used you all along!
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_ABANDONED5,Seija: You came because you wanted my treasure too, didn’t you? Don’t think I didn’t notice.
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_ABANDONED6,Seija: Amanojaku don’t have allies! You were just being used from the start!
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_ABANDONED7,Seija: Everything I said about being your partner? All lies. I'm an Amanojaku, after all!
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_ABANDON1,Seija: What? You think you can betray *me*? Think again!
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_ABANDON2,Seija: I knew it. I never needed an ally. You’re going to die horribly!
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_ABANDON3,Seija: Trying to use *me*, an Amanojaku? You've got guts!
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_ABANDON4,Seija: You’re gonna regret this!
