LOC_SYSTEM_TENSI_BAD_SUMMON2,Tenshi: If you won’t fight... then I’ll make you fight!
LOC_SYSTEM_TENSI_BAD_SUMMON3,Tenshi: I wanna see how strong you’ve gotten!

LOC_SYSTEM_TENSI_WEAPON1,A red aura begins to gather in your hands.
LOC_SYSTEM_TENSI_WEAPON2,Tenshi: That weapon looks lame!
LOC_SYSTEM_TENSI_WEAPON3,Tenshi: Just borrowing it for a bit!
LOC_SYSTEM_TENSI_WEAPON4,Tenshi: Now you won't lose to anyone!
LOC_SYSTEM_TENSI_WEAPON5,Tenshi: This is a secret, okay? Don’t tell anyone!
LOC_SYSTEM_TENSI_WEAPON6,Tenshi: Do I *have* to return it?
LOC_SYSTEM_TENSI_WEAPON7,Tenshi: If I get caught, Iku's gonna yell at me...
LOC_SYSTEM_TENSI_KANAME1,Tenshi sends reinforcements to your side.
LOC_SYSTEM_TENSI_KANAME2,Tenshi: With this, you won’t lose, right?
LOC_SYSTEM_TENSI_KANAME3,Tenshi: They’re my favorite little cuties!
LOC_SYSTEM_TENSI_KANAME4,Tenshi: Ever heard of a *pet rock*?
LOC_SYSTEM_TENSI_KANAME5,Tenshi: Handle them with care!
LOC_SYSTEM_TENSI_KANAME6,Tenshi: Kaname Funnels—go!
LOC_SYSTEM_TENSI_BAD_KANAME1,Tenshi: You might wanna step back.
LOC_SYSTEM_TENSI_BAD_KANAME2,Tenshi: Ever slept on a *rock bed*?
LOC_SYSTEM_TENSI_BAD_KANAME3,Tenshi: My rocks don’t bite… but they *do* shoot!
LOC_SYSTEM_TENSI_BAD_KANAME4,Tenshi: Let’s see if you can survive *here*!
LOC_SYSTEM_TENSI_BAD_KANAME5,Tenshi: Just made this new spell card—wanna help me test it?
LOC_SYSTEM_TENSI_BAD_KANAME6,Tenshi: How about some target practice? You're the target, of course!
LOC_SYSTEM_TENSI_FIELD1,You feel a great barrier forming around you.
LOC_SYSTEM_TENSI_FIELD2,Tenshi: Need a new battlefield?
LOC_SYSTEM_TENSI_FIELD3,Tenshi: Looks way more fun to fight *here*!
LOC_SYSTEM_TENSI_FIELD4,Tenshi: I’m pitching a tent—mind lending a hand?
LOC_SYSTEM_TENSI_FIELD5,Tenshi: Want to try fighting in better conditions?
LOC_SYSTEM_TENSI_BLIND1,Tenshi: I’m gonna nap—can you dim the lights?
LOC_SYSTEM_TENSI_BLIND2,Tenshi: Isn’t it *way* too bright?
LOC_SYSTEM_TENSI_BLIND3,Tenshi: Don’t you think this’ll be more *fun*?
LOC_SYSTEM_TENSI_BLIND4,Tenshi: What you see isn’t always the truth!
LOC_SYSTEM_TENSI_DEBUFF1,Tenshi manipulates the flow around you.
LOC_SYSTEM_TENSI_DEBUFF2,Tenshi: If you still lose after all this… you better be ready.
LOC_SYSTEM_TENSI_DEBUFF3,Tenshi: I’m in a good mood today, so here’s a special gift!
LOC_SYSTEM_TENSI_DEBUFF4,Tenshi: This one’s more like… making your enemies *look* slow?
LOC_SYSTEM_TENSI_DEBUFF5,Tenshi: Think this’ll be enough?
LOC_SYSTEM_TENSI_DEBUFF6,Tenshi: You all move like slugs!
LOC_SYSTEM_TENSI_SUCIDE1,Tenshi: Let me introduce you to some *fun* friends!
LOC_SYSTEM_TENSI_SUCIDE2,Tenshi: They’re nice folks—aside from being a bit... *aggressive*!
LOC_SYSTEM_TENSI_SUCIDE3,Tenshi: Do you like explosions?
LOC_SYSTEM_TENSI_SUCIDE4,Tenshi: Brave, sure—but they don’t really watch out for allies.
LOC_SYSTEM_TENSI_SUCIDE5,Tenshi: Play nice together, even if it’s just for a moment!
LOC_SYSTEM_TENSI_SUCIDE6,Tenshi: I don’t really get suicide charges... Do they follow some weird faith or something?
LOC_SYSTEM_TENSI_SUCIDE7,Tenshi: Nothing clears a room like this!
LOC_SYSTEM_TENSI_FOG1,Tenshi: Today’s forecast—thick fog!
LOC_SYSTEM_TENSI_FOG2,Tenshi: I don’t really like foggy days.
LOC_SYSTEM_TENSI_FOG3,Tenshi: Can you even fight in this weather?
LOC_SYSTEM_TENSI_FOG4,Tenshi: Ugh, it’s all damp and dark!
LOC_SYSTEM_TENSI_FOG5,Tenshi: Perfect weather to stay hidden!
LOC_SYSTEM_TENSI_FOG6,Tenshi: Weather manifestation—activate!
LOC_SYSTEM_TENSI_THUNDER1,Tenshi: Today’s weather—heavy thunder and lightning!
LOC_SYSTEM_TENSI_THUNDER2,Tenshi: Let’s make this flashy!
LOC_SYSTEM_TENSI_THUNDER3,Tenshi: What’s the chance you’ll get struck?
LOC_SYSTEM_TENSI_THUNDER4,Tenshi: Yeah… you’re not dodging *this* one.
LOC_SYSTEM_TENSI_THUNDER5,Tenshi: Hope you’re wearing something non-conductive!
LOC_SYSTEM_TENSI_THUNDER6,Tenshi: *Boom! Boom! Rumble!*
LOC_SYSTEM_TENSI_THUNDER7,Tenshi: O blade of the storm—gather thunder from the skies!
LOC_SYSTEM_TENSI_SUN1,Tenshi: Today’s forecast—clear skies and blazing sun!
LOC_SYSTEM_TENSI_SUN2,Tenshi: How is sunlight even reaching the dungeon? Eh, who cares!
LOC_SYSTEM_TENSI_SUN3,Tenshi: Who could possibly hide under sunlight like this?
LOC_SYSTEM_TENSI_SUN4,Tenshi: Gotta dry some laundry real quick!
LOC_SYSTEM_TENSI_SUN5,Tenshi: Sunlight—shine!
LOC_SYSTEM_TENSI_SUN6,Tenshi: The Sword of Hisou can do this too!
LOC_SYSTEM_TENSI_SUN7,Tenshi: Today’s perfect for a picnic!
LOC_SYSTEM_TENSI_WHISPERING,Tenshi whispered in an inaudible voice.
LOC_SYSTEM_TENSI_WEATHER1,A thick fog began to spread, making it hard to see even an inch ahead.
LOC_SYSTEM_TENSI_WEATHER2,Heavy rain and thunderstorm began to rage through the dungeon.
LOC_SYSTEM_TENSI_WEATHER3,Bright sunlight began to shine into the dungeon.
LOC_SYSTEM_TENSI_BRAND_WEAPON,The aura of Hisou surges from {0}.
LOC_SYSTEM_TENSI_MORE_BRAND_WEAPON,{0} is further empowered by the force of Hisou.
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_SUMMON_BUFF1,Seija: Run!
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_SUMMON_BUFF2,Seija: A head-on fight? We don’t stand a chance!
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_SUMMON_BUFF3,Seija: I’ll give you a speed boost, now run!
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_SUMMON_BUFF4,Seija: They’re slowpokes, just shake them off!
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_SUMMON_BUFF5,Seija: You’re not thinking of fighting, are you?
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_SUMMON_BUFF6,Seija: They're already chasing us?
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_SUMMON_BUFF7,Seija: It’s them again. Let’s lose them.
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_SUMMON_BUFF8,Seija: Isn't it cheating to push through with numbers?
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_SUMMON_BUFF9,Seija: Like that’ll help you catch us!
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_SUMMON_BUFF10,Seija: Don’t you ever get tired of this!?
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_GOD_JOON_AND_SION1,Seija: I don’t really want their stuff… but do you want it?
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_GOD_JOON_AND_SION2,Seija: They’re plague-ridden anyway, they’d have lost it even if I didn’t steal it.
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_GOD_JOON_AND_SION3,Seija: Not many people are more hated than me, you know.
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_GOD_JOON_AND_SION4,Seija: I’d rather not get too close to that bunch.
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_GOD_BYAKUREN1,Seija: Equality for youkai and humans? That just screams hypocrisy!
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_GOD_BYAKUREN2,Seija: When I went to steal from the temple, there were piles of booze! Total heretics!
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_GOD_BYAKUREN3,Seija: These magic books were at that temple. I got caught sneaking in when a Yamabiko barked at me.
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_GOD_BYAKUREN4,Seija: The head monk there gave off some seriously dangerous vibes… but I got out safely!
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_GOD_KANAKO1,Seija: That god had a silver tongue, like a snake. Not that persuasion works on me.
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_GOD_KANAKO2,Seija: What are we even gonna do with all this junk? You can have it if you want.
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_GOD_KANAKO3,Seija: That god, I mean. What terrible fashion sense... just awful.
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_GOD_KANAKO4,Seija: Dodging that pillar was pretty tough... Try to avoid it well!
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_GOD_SUWAKO1,Seija: That little kid was a god? Didn’t look all that strong.
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_GOD_SUWAKO2,Seija: There were tons of frogs there. Not really a fan, honestly.
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_GOD_SUWAKO3,Seija: That goddess of misfortune—she’s more dangerous than she looks.
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_GOD_SUWAKO4,Seija: This item carries a curse with it. You sure you want it?
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_GOD_MINORIKO1,Seija: Even on the run, you’ve still gotta eat. Here, have some.
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_GOD_MINORIKO2,Seija: I’ve had enough of sweet potatoes… was thinking of giving them away.
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_GOD_MINORIKO3,Seija: These sweet potatoes are from that harvest goddess... huh? What was her name again?
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_GOD_MINORIKO4,Seija: You must’ve been hungry, huh? Go ahead, take some.
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_GOD_MIMA1,Seija: I heard it contains the ultimate magic. Use it wisely.
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_GOD_MIMA2,Seija: Is this that “Spark” spellbook or something? That magic’s totally broken.
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_GOD_MIMA3,Seija: A vengeful spirit? It was written by one!? I won’t be cursed for reading it, right?
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_GOD_MIMA4,Seija: You’ve got a good eye. That’s a pretty rare book.
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_GOD_SHINKI1,Seija: A god of Makai? You mean that dopey-looking one?
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_GOD_SHINKI2,Seija: I was surprised Makai wasn’t a total wreck. I expected some ugly monsters.
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_GOD_SHINKI3,Seija: It’s easy to get lost in Makai. Be careful if you ever go.
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_GOD_SHINKI4,Seija: The demons chased me endlessly… Take this and try to throw them off my trail, yeah?
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_GOD_YUUGI1,Seija: I’d rather avoid fighting an oni. Run as fast as you can.
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_GOD_YUUGI2,Seija: These armors are one of the oni’s treasures. Too bad I got to them first.
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_GOD_YUUGI3,Seija: You’ll need armor if you want to survive a punch from an oni.
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_GOD_YUUGI4,Seija: I think I have a personality that oni love to hate. Mind dealing with them for me?
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_GOD_SHIZUHA1,Seija: Fallen maple leaves are just pathetic, don’t you think?
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_GOD_SHIZUHA2,Seija: That god seemed like they’d leave no impression at all. Here, take this.
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_GOD_SHIZUHA3,Seija: Not sure, but when I took this, I felt like someone was watching me the whole time.
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_GOD_SHIZUHA4,Seija: Honestly, the best fights are the ones where you stab 'em in the back. Agree?
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_GOD_HINA1,Seija: I didn’t need these cursed items anyway. Take them all.
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_GOD_HINA2,Seija: Looks like a valuable ring, sure… but it gives me the creeps. No thanks.
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_GOD_HINA3,Seija: Someone actually curses their own gear on purpose? No way.
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_GOD_HINA4,Seija: I’ll give it to you if you want, but watch out for the curse.
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_GOD_YUKARI1,Seija: I didn’t want to get mixed up with that creepy youkai.
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_GOD_YUKARI2,Seija: That youkai was sleeping when I went to steal these.
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_GOD_YUKARI3,Seija: Nothing beats a teleport item when you’re on the run. Use it well.
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_GOD_YUKARI4,Seija: Teleporting’s useful, but man, the nausea is real. Ugh.
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_GOD_EIRIN1,Seija: I stole these potions from that apothecary’s house. Not sure what they do though.
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_GOD_EIRIN2,Seija: A pharmacist, huh? Then why all the poison?
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_GOD_EIRIN3,Seija: That room was full of weird tools I’d never seen before. Looked dangerous, so I passed.
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_GOD_EIRIN4,Seija: When you’re in a bind, there’s nothing like a good potion. Stay safe out there!
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_GOD_YUYUKO1,Seija: I really don’t wanna climb that long staircase again.
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_GOD_YUYUKO2,Seija: Ever since I stole this, ghosts won’t stop showing up.
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_GOD_YUYUKO3,Seija: A wraith that deals in death? That’s ominous.
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_GOD_YUYUKO4,Seija: Ghosts are easy to shake off, right? I believe in you, partner.
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_GOD_SATORI1,Seija: A mind-reading youkai, huh... Creepy.
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_GOD_SATORI2,Seija: I can't tell if they're pets or just being left to roam free.
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_GOD_SATORI3,Seija: Didn't seem all that strong. Wouldn’t want to run into them again though.
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_GOD_SATORI4,Seija: Hated as much as me, huh? Doesn’t mean I feel any camaraderie.
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_GOD_TENSI1,Seija: Someone actually trusts a guy like that? Strange taste, I must say.
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_GOD_TENSI2,Seija: Watch out for falling rocks from the sky.
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_GOD_TENSI3,Seija: You really need this junk? You’ve got unique taste.
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_GOD_TENSI4,Seija: For a celestial’s stuff, it all looked pretty cheap.
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_GOD_LILLY1,Seija: Fairies? Fighting for rights? What nonsense are they spouting now?
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_GOD_LILLY2,Seija: Fairies are just like bugs—no matter how many you squash, they keep coming back.
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_GOD_LILLY3,Seija: Not sure if fairy gear will help, but I swiped some. Give it a try.
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_GOD_LILLY4,Seija: That fairy just bombarded everything without looking. Total menace.
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_GOD_MIKO1,Seija: I got my hands on one of that show-off’s favorite capes.
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_GOD_MIKO2,Seija: I’ve already got one I like better, so you can have this.
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_GOD_MIKO3,Seija: Acts noble on the outside, but sly as a fox inside. I can tell.
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_GOD_MIKO4,Seija: Red cape? Blue cape? I dunno, doesn’t matter to me.
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_GOD_OKINA1,Seija: I broke a sweat trying to ditch that weird dancing group.
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_GOD_OKINA2,Seija: As if I’d ever be someone like that guy’s lackey.
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_GOD_OKINA3,Seija: I heard this item makes you invincible for a bit. Use it well.
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_GOD_OKINA4,Seija: I saw a door behind me, walked in, and stole this.
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_GOD_JUNKO1,Seija: Enhancing your gear is what really matters, right?
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_GOD_JUNKO2,Seija: Muttering about killing someone the whole time? What a creep.
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_GOD_JUNKO3,Seija: Purification is a blessing? What’s the point if you can’t use the item anymore?
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_GOD_JUNKO4,Seija: We might not have brute strength, but we’ve got brains—and gear.
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_WELCOME1,Seija: A new resistance is born! Welcome aboard!
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_WELCOME2,Seija: We’re gonna make the best team ever!
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_WELCOME3,Seija: Let’s give those arrogant jerks a taste of their own medicine!
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_WELCOME4,Seija: This is the beginning of our uprising!
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_WELCOME5,Seija: Power to the weak! Punishment for the strong!
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_REFUSE_ITEM1,Seija: Really? You don’t need any items? I kinda admire that confidence.
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_REFUSE_ITEM2,Seija: You’ll still help me out, even if you don’t take the gift, right?
LOC_SYSTEM_SEIJA_REFUSE_ITEM3,Seija: No need to be polite, you know.
